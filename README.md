### Hej, I'm Daniel

Just another full-stack developer.<br>

Currently Full-Stack Developer at `         ` and part-time contributor to tRPC.<br>

Previous [consultant](https://futurice.com/), builder of booking systems at [Carglass Nordics](https://www.carglass.se/), developer of a video streaming at [Znipe](https://znipe.tv/), and guest lecturer at [Hyper Island](https://new.hyperisland.com/programs/full-time-programs/frontend-developer).<br>

Working mostly with TypeScript, but I've worked with Go, Swift, and C# in the past. Live by the mantra of [make it work, make it right, make it fast.](https://thetombomb.com/posts/make-it-work-right-fast).<br>
